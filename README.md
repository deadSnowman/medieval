# Medieval

This program mimics the functionality of the tf2 chat parser used in DeGroot Keep.  The input turns into something similar to "Ye Old English" by following rules set in a provided json file.  This could potentially be used for pirate speak or something
in the future.


## Fix/Implement:

Well, decided to come back and remake this now that I know more.
The basic structure is there, but I still need to:

- get insults working
- finish adding the replacement words
